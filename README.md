# Overview <br />

The programs are designed to use A* algorithm to solve 15 puzzle problem <br />

#Software requirement: <br />

Before running program, please install packages listed in "requirements.txt". You can use "pip install -r requirements.txt" under unix environment <br />
The program is implemented in linux. For windows user, please use cygwin <br />

#To run the code: <br />

use "main.py", you can change the start point. However, the main idea of the code is to show how the A* algorithm works on 15 puzzle problem. The implementation is not optimized so it could be very slow to solve certain cases.<br />

#Design Idea: <br />

Use lecture notes for A* algithm from Dr.Dimitrov Ned, ut austin.
